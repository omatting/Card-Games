# WARMUP Notes

*INSTRUCTIONS:* 
*A reminder that, to get credit on the Warmup each week, you need to write responses in this WARMUP.md file. **Warmup responses should be similar to when an instructor asks you to explain your reasoning for clicker questions/answers during the lecture periods.*** 

*Sometimes the Warmup work happens in different .py files, the console, paper/whiteboard. Please note where that work is (e.g., “see filename.py”) or include notes about implementing that functionality in each subpart below. If you did substantial work on paper/whiteboard, feel free to upload a picture and refer to that in your responses below (e.g., “see filename.jpeg” for our pseudocode).*

## Part A: Square Up

The code was already very close to achieving the desired task. To fix it I changed the rotational values to 90 (90 degrees). and changed the forward values to 50

## Part B: Pattern Practice

1. The code is printing the numbers from one to the provided number with spaces in between them.

2. We added another loop inside the other loop to add rows.

3. I used the double nested loop feature of python the first loop represented each collum of which there were N #, and the nested loop printed the integers from 1 to N with spaces in between them. 


## Part C: Countdown!
1. We changed the range from N, -1, -1 to N + 1 this represented the time passed acurately

2. [It would flip the values provided for "minutes left" and "minutes remaining"]

3. [I would change the time_remaining and time_passed in the print statements]

4. [We moved the time_remaining calculation above the print statements so it would occur before the print statement]

5. [N was used for two different thing so we changed the index of the for loop to i]



**P.S. Markdown is a text editor format, rather than a programming format. You should be able to write in .md files just like you would in normal Word or TextEdit files. What makes them special is their use of formatting (hashtags for headers, etc.)**
